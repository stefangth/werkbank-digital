    // The idempotency key (resendIdempotencyKey, _shared/invitations.ts) folds in
    // resent_count (the value BEFORE this send's own mark_invitation_resent bump below)
    // AND a coarse now()-bucket, not just invite.id: send-transactional-email forwards
    // this key to Resend as its `Idempotency-Key` header, which Resend treats as "the
    // same logical send" for 24 hours and replies 200 for the ORIGINAL message on any
    // repeat within that window without re-delivering. A key scoped to invite.id alone
    // would make every resend of the same invitation within 24h of the last one collapse
    // into that guarantee. resent_count alone narrows that to "within one resend
    // attempt" (two requests racing before either one's stamp lands read the same
    // resent_count and get the same key, so a double-click or network retry still
    // dedupes as intended) but mark_invitation_resent's write is best-effort: if it
    // silently fails after a real send succeeded, a later GENUINE resend would still
    // read the same stale resent_count and collide for the rest of that 24-hour window.
