  // org can book straight to confirmed with no offer step at all, see

/**
 * Vocabulary templates: the copy keys that name a domain noun, authored with {{noun}}
 * variables. resolveEmailCopy substitutes these against the resolved workspace-type
 * table (staffing swaps the words) for any key still at its language default. Kept
 * SEPARATE from EMAIL_COPY_DEFAULTS / EMAIL_COPY_DE, which stay clean prose, because
 * every template component and subject function reads those default maps RAW (their
 * `_emailCopy = EMAIL_COPY_DEFAULTS` fallback and `template.subject`), so a bare
 * {{noun}} token in the defaults would leak into any direct or default render. Under the
 * production table every value here substitutes back to the exact clean default, which
 * is the byte-identity guarantee (guarded by emailCopy.orgKind.test.ts). Keys are a
 * subset of EmailCopyKey. Most keys exist in both locales, but a few are EN-only: where
 * the German literal does not equal the registry's German production word (the hire-order
 * short form "Vertrag" vs the registry "Engagementvertrag") or needs article agreement a
 * bare variable cannot give ("eine Produktion" vs staffing "Kunde"), tokenizing German
 * would break DE byte-identity, so the German key stays a clean-prose default until that
 * wording is reconciled. English is the canonical, always-on locale (German ships behind
 * the language_packages entitlement), so EN staffing still gets the swapped word.
