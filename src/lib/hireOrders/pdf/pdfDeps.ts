// NOT MIRRORED. render.tsx is byte-identical across runtimes; this file is the
// one place the two differ. The Deno twin lives at
// supabase/functions/_shared/hire-order-pdf/pdfDeps.ts.
//
// Geist and Geist Mono are base64-embedded from src/lib/pdf/fonts.ts, exactly as the
// edge shim does, so the DEFAULT theme renders with zero network I/O here
// too. Earlier this file fetched every family (Geist included) from the
// public `hire-order-fonts` Storage bucket, which is empty until an operator
// uploads to it: every fetch 400'd, `available` came back empty and the live
// preview silently fell back to Helvetica. That is not merely a different
// typeface - Helvetica and Geist have different metrics, so line breaks and
// pagination differ, and an org could size text to fit in a preview that the
// real PDF then reflows. The bytes are shared with the edge through the
// mirror (scripts/mirrors.manifest.json), never hand-duplicated. Everything
// else is still fetched from the bucket on demand.
//
// The extra weight is paid only on entering the editor: this module is
// reached solely through render.tsx -> TemplateDocumentPane ->
// TemplateEditorPage, which App.tsx `lazy()`-loads.
