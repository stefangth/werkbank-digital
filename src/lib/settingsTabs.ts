// Deep-linking into a Settings section: `/settings?tab=<value>`.
//
// The values are the SettingsPage <TabsTrigger value> strings, and every one is a deep-link
// target. "hire-orders" is entitlement-gated (this pure helper cannot see the org's
// entitlement) but is still a safe deep-link target: SettingsPage renders its trigger and
// content for any admin/producer regardless of entitlement (with a module-off indicator),
// so a `?tab=hire-orders` link is no worse than the tab an admin can already click by hand,
// and HireOrdersTab self-gates on `useFeature`. Admin-only "permissions" IS listed, but gated below on the caller's role, and
// "docs" (Documentation) is likewise listed but gated below to super-admins only — it is no
// longer a reachable deep-link target for an admin or producer. The concept explainers that
// used to deep-link here now point at the Help center instead (see ROUTES.HELP). "people"
// and "activity" are the former standalone Admin page's tabs, folded in as an admin-only
// group; `/admin` now redirects straight to `?tab=people`. Its former "sync-log" tab was
// retired (duplicate of the Airtable sync tab's own history view) rather than folded in.
//
// For callers building a link: SettingsPage follows the param whether or not it is already
// mounted (it seeds from this helper and re-runs on a change of `?tab=`), so an in-app
// notification or menu item may link to `/settings?tab=airtable` from anywhere, including
// from Settings itself. The page does not rewrite the URL when the user then switches tabs
// by hand, so the param is a starting point, not a lock.
