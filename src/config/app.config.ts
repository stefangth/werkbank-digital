 * individually org-toggleable, so a producer may not actually get everything this

 *
 * The artist line deliberately says nothing about declaring availability: that action
 * lives behind /availability, itself gated by the booking_flow entitlement (see
 * ROUTE_FEATURES in src/config/app.config.ts), so an org with that module off has
 * artists who cannot reach it at all. An earlier draft hedged with "where that is
