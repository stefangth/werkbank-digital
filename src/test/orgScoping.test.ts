/**
 * Guard: tenant-table reads must be scoped to the ACTIVE org.
 *
 * Why this file exists.
 *
 * RLS does NOT narrow rows to the org a user is currently viewing. The RESTRICTIVE
 * `org_isolation` policy on every tenant table is `is_org_member(auth.uid(), org_id)`,
 * and that helper is `is_super_admin(_uid) OR exists(membership)`. So it is true for
 * EVERY org for a super-admin, and true for every org a multi-org member belongs to.
 * Several tables (`casts`, `cast_members`, `shows`, `show_dates`, `cities`, `skills`, …)
 * additionally carry a PERMISSIVE `SELECT ... USING (true)`, which leaves `org_isolation`
 * as their only row filter.
 *
 * ADR-0003 states this deliberately: "Isolation never depends on the active-org UI
 * filter … RLS guarantees a session can only ever read orgs it BELONGS TO." Narrowing
 * from "orgs I may read" to "the org I am viewing" is the client's job.
 *
 * A single forgotten `.eq("org_id", orgId)` therefore renders another org's data — which
 * is exactly the bug this suite was written for (a super-admin entering a fresh org still
 * saw the previous org's bookings and casts). The mistake is invisible in single-org dev
 * data, so it needs a machine to catch it.
 *
 * Two rules:
 *
 *   1. SAFETY (everywhere): every tenant-table SELECT carries either an org filter or a
 *      UUID-FK filter. A UUID belongs to exactly one org, so `.eq("show_date_id", …)` is
 *      inherently org-safe; an unqualified list read is not. This is the rule that
 *      actually prevents the bug.
 *
 *   2. LOCATION (list reads only): a SELECT whose only scoping is the org filter — i.e.
 *      a list read — must live in `src/data/**` (or a plugin's own data layer,
 *      `src/features/<plugin>/data/**`), where it is testable against
 *      `supabaseFake` and reviewable in one place. UUID-scoped reads and writes may
 *      still sit inline; migrating those too is desirable but is not what stops a leak.
